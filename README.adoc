= Welcome to the Apache Camel Spring-Boot Examples

== Introduction

This project contains the various examples for working with Apache
Camel Spring Boot. The examples can be run using Maven. When using the Maven
command, Maven will attempt to download the required dependencies from a
central repository to your local repository.
View the individual example READMEs for details.

=== Executing

Master branch should only be used for development purposes, which will be pointing
to the SNAPSHOT version of the next release.

To execute the examples, checkout into the tag for the latest release. For example:

`$ git checkout tags/camel-spring-boot-examples-3.5.0`

Then, install the root pom:

`$ mvn install`

After that, you should be able to execute the examples following each example's
readme's instructions.

== Deploying the examples in openshift or dev-sandbox using devfiles

=== Pre-requisites

- https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation[Install odo (Preferred odo version - 2.x)]

=== Steps:

- First login to your openshift or dev-sandbox and create a new project. Here $EXAMPLE  is the name of the example you want to deploy:

        $ oc new-project csbex-$EXAMPLE

- Create an odo component using the devfile.yaml

        $ odo create csb-ubi8 --app $EXAMPLE 

- To set the specific example you want to deploy as an env variable (SUB_FOLDER):

        $ odo config set --env SUB_FOLDER=$EXAMPLE

- Then push it to openshift cluster:

        $ odo push

=== Note: 

- Only few examples can be deployed using devfile:

        fhir-auth-tx, geocoder, health-checks, kamelet-chucknorris, load-balancer-eip, metrics, paho-mqtt5-shared-subscriptions, pojo, quartz, reactive-streams, rest-jpa, rest-openapi-springdoc,
        rest-openapi, rest-producer, rest-swagger, route-reload, routetemplate, splitter-eip, spring-boot, supervising-route-controller, type-converter, unit-testing, validator, xml-import and xml.

- Please delete `.odo folder` in your repository before starting to deploy another example, so that it will delete the components related to previous example.

- If you have an internal repository, set the MAVEN_MIRROR_URL environment with your maven repo before pushing:

        $ odo config set --env MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=https://my-maven-mirror/
